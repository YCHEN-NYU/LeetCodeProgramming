37. Sudoku Solver
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

(1) Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
(2) Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
(3) Each of the the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
(4) Empty cells are indicated by the character '.'.

A sudoku puzzle...
...and its solution numbers marked in red.

Note:
The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique solution.
The given board size is always 9x9.
